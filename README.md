# simple-hamburger-menu

I created this project because I'm bored of always making hamburger menus. I love the experience it brings, but I'm just sick of coding them.

Feel free to use this code, it's free and opensource. There's a ReactJS version and a vanilla version. Use the one that suits you best.
